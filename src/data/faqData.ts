    answer:
      "It depends on your property type: Single-Family Properties: 1 Detached ADU, 1 Conversion ADU (e.g., from a garage or existing space), 1 JADU (Junior ADU, inside the main home). Multifamily Properties: Up to 2 Detached ADUs, Conversion ADUs from non-living spaces like storage rooms or garages—up to 25% of existing units.",
  },

    question: "What is a Junior ADU (JADU)?",
    answer:
      "A JADU is a compact living unit (up to 500 sq ft) created within your main home. It must have a separate entrance and its own kitchenette. A JADU may share a bathroom with the main house and is ideal for multigenerational living.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit to build an ADU?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All ADUs in California require permits for planning, building, and safety. Cities are required by law to process ADU permits within 60 days.",
  },
  {
    question: "How big can my ADU be?",
    answer:
      "Per California state law: Detached ADUs: Up to 1,200 sq ft. Attached ADUs: Up to 50% of the existing home's living area, or 800 sq ft, whichever is less. JADUs: Up to 500 sq ft.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to live on the property to build an ADU?",
    answer:
      "No. From 2020 through at least 2025, California does not require owner-occupancy for new ADUs. However, if you're building a JADU, you must live in either the main house or the JADU.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I rent out my ADU?",
    answer:
      "Yes. ADUs can be rented as long-term housing (30 days or more) statewide. Short-term rentals (under 30 days) may be limited or require a local permit, depending on city ordinances.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to add parking for an ADU?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "Can I convert my garage into an ADU?",

  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build an ADU?",
    answer:
      "Most ADUs take about 6 to 12 months, depending on design complexity, permitting, and construction. Using pre-approved plans can speed up the timeline significantly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there pre-approved ADU plans available?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many California cities and counties offer Permit-Ready ADU (PRADU) plans, which save time and design fees. These plans are pre-reviewed to meet local code.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I build an ADU on a historic property or in a historic district?",
    answer:

  },
  {

export const financingFaqData: QA[] = [
  {
    question: "How can I finance the construction of an ADU?",
    answer:
      "There are several common options: Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) – great if you have strong equity. Cash-Out Refinance – replaces your current mortgage with a new one at a higher amount. Renovation Loans (like FHA 203(k) or Fannie Mae HomeStyle) – bundles ADU costs into your mortgage. Construction Loans – short-term financing that converts into a mortgage after the ADU is built. Personal Loans or Cash – for smaller ADUs or JADUs with lower upfront costs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use rental income from the ADU to qualify for a loan?",
    answer:
      "Yes, in many cases. Some lenders will count future rental income from your ADU as qualifying income, which can help you get approved or borrow more. You'll likely need a signed lease or an appraiser's rental estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any grants or incentive programs in California for building an ADU?",
    answer:
      "Yes. California has offered ADU grant programs (like the CalHFA $40,000 ADU Grant) to help cover pre-development costs like permits, design, and site prep. These programs may open and close periodically, so check with your lender or local housing agency for availability.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much down payment do I need for an ADU loan?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the type of loan: HELOCs and cash-out refinances often require 10–20% equity. Renovation loans may allow down payments as low as 3–5%. Construction loans usually require 20% or more upfront. Every lender is different, so it's important to compare your options.",

export const permittingFaqData: QA[] = [
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit to build an ADU?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You need permits for: Planning/zoning (to make sure the ADU meets city/state rules). Building (structural, electrical, plumbing). Inspections (to ensure safety and code compliance). The good news? California law requires cities to approve ADU permits within 60 days of a complete application — and many now offer online portals and streamlined review.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the process to get an ADU approved?",
    answer:
      "The typical steps: 1. Site Evaluation & Design, 2. Submit Plans to the City. 3. Permit Review & Approval, 4. Construction Begins, 5. City Inspections During and After Build. 6. Final Approval & Certificate of Occupancy. Working with a design-build firm or experienced architect can make this smoother and faster.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build an ADU?",
    answer:
      "From start to finish, most ADUs take 6 to 12 months, depending on: Your design complexity. City permitting speed. Contractor availability. Garage conversions or prefab ADUs may be faster (as little as 3–6 months), while custom builds may take longer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What building codes and rules apply to ADUs in California?",
    answer:
      "All ADUs must follow: California Residential Building Code. Title 24 Energy Efficiency Standards. Local city or county regulations (like height, setbacks, and fire access). State law overrides many local restrictions, but it's always smart to check with your local planning department or hire a pro to guide you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I build an ADU myself, or do I need a licensed contractor?",
    answer:
      'Legally, a homeowner can act as an "owner-builder," but it\'s not recommended unless you have construction experience. Most people hire: A licensed general contractor. Or a design-build team who handles the whole process (design, permits, build). Hiring professionals ensures your ADU is done right, on time, and up to code.',
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to notify my neighbors or get their approval to build an ADU?",
    answer:
      "No. Under California state law, you are not required to get neighbor approval to build an ADU. As long as your project meets state and local building codes, zoning rules, and permit requirements, you can move forward without any neighbor sign-off.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the common reasons an ADU permit gets delayed or denied?",
    answer:
      "Most delays happen when: Plans are incomplete or unclear. The ADU violates zoning rules (like height or setback limits). Missing documents (site plans, structural details, energy reports, etc.). Working with a knowledgeable designer or builder familiar with your city can help avoid these issues and get approvals faster.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I live in the ADU while it's being built or converted?",
    answer:
      "Not usually. For new construction, you can't live in the ADU until it's completed and passes final inspection. If you're converting part of your existing home, like a garage or basement, you may still live in the main house — but expect some disruption from noise, construction, and access needs.",
